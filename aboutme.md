Hello! I'm Zhenlin Zhu, currently a PhD candidatein astrophysics working in SRON and Leiden University. 
Take it easy! This page is not about my research, but just about me and my life.



### Cooking 🧑‍🍳
As a girl from Chengdu, cooking without spicy is definitely not okay for me!
Thanks to covid situation, I have tried many hometown recipies at home with my bf.
